	</h2>
	<p>
	  <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>is simply dummy text of the
	  printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
	  industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
	  unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
	  make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
	  centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
	  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
	  1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
	  Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
	  software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
	  Ipsum.

          <span>Why do we use it?</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is a long established fact that a reader will be
          distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
          its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
          more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
          using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
          readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
          page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
          text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
          sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
          over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
          (injected humour and the like).
